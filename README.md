A brick for Mason CLI that generates a clean architecture template for a given feature.


## üìñ Introduction

This brick was created to improve performance while developing new features to a Flutter project.

For a best fit, the project must follows a set of rules from Clean Architecture, specifically from [Clean-Dart](https://github.com/Flutterando/Clean-Dart)

For the purpose of keep things easy I have modified some ideas of the Clean-Dart, and implemented some other points that I think it's important for the project. The complete code structure is the next:

- Domain
  - Entities
  - Failures
  - Repositories
  - Usecases
  - Validators (Not supported)
- Infrastructure
  - Mappers
  - Datasources
  - Errors
  - Repositories
- External
  - Datasources
  - Settings (in some cases)
- Presentation
  - Controllers
    - Bloc
      - Events
      - States
    - Stores
  - Pages (Not supported)
  - Widgets (Not supported)

This structure is detailed in the ARCHITECTURE.md file.

## üöÄ Getting Started


### üß© Variables

This brick has currently two variables that can be set by the user, they are

- `module_name`:\
  The name of the module you want to create.

  Default to `feature`.

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è The brick was projected to work with [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). ‚ö†Ô∏è
  > 
  > Using other case when setting `module_name` can result in code not being correctly structured.


- `has_parameters`:\
  A boolean variable that defines if the module will pass some parameters to the backend.

  If set to `true` it will generate a parameters entity and mapper that will be used throught the layers.\
  If set to `false` it won't generate the entity and mapper.

  Defaults to `false`.

### üîí Internal Variables

As said, I've modified the Clean-Dart structure while building this brick. One of those things is that I have some custom files that are used throught the layers, but the brick can't identify those files since you can run it in any folder of the project.\
The solution was to create a pre-generation script (basically a hook) that will identify the root of the app (the lib folder) and set some paths from this lib folder.

For example, I have a generic class named Failure that I use in the architecture. The pre-gen script will get the path of this file and add to the lib path, so it can be set as a import wherever it's needed. The user don't have to manually import it.

If, for any reason, the pre-gen script can't find a lib folder it will simply return, the variables won't be setted, and the imports won't appear.

Talking about those internal variables, they are five and their respective paths are:

- `failure_path`:\
  The path to the generic Failure, a generic class that all failures in the project must implement.

  Path to file: `project_name/lib/app/core/shared/domain/failures/failure.dart`

- `request_client_path`:\
  The path to the request client used in the project, in this case I've created an abstraction of a request client, which is what it's going to be imported.

  Path to file: `project_name/lib/app/core/packages/request_client/request_client.dart`

- `services_settings_path`:\
  The path to the services settings, which is the base endpoint to all requests.

  Path to file: `project_name/lib/app/core/shared/external/settings/services_settings.dart`

- `generic_query_path`:\
  The path to the generic query structure, it gives a base that all requests use.

  Path to file: `project_name/lib/app/core/shared/infrastructure/mappers/name_method_query_mapper.dart`
  
- `message_parser_path`:\
  The path to a message parser. If the backend returns anything other than a success this class can parse and return a message of the problem.

  Path to file: `project_name/lib/app/core/helpers/server_error_message_parser.dart`


### ‚öôÔ∏è How to run it

If you have already used any mason brick you basically know what to do. But I'll explain some details and give some tips.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Installing this brick

At the time of this creation, only allowed people can publish to the [BrickHub](https://brickhub.dev/) since it's on open alpha.\
I have requested access so it can be publically available for you, but until then you can use the following steps to install this brick:

1. Install mason through the dart command\
   I found that the best way to install mason is by using [their recommended way](https://docs.brickhub.dev/installing/#-pubdev).

   This can be done by running this dart command in the terminal

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate mason_cli
   ```
   
   Keep in mind that if you use multiple versions of the Dart SDK you can see a warning while running the brick with a different dart version than the one you have installed the mason. The terminal shows a message saying it couldn't find the kernel, but at the end it manages to run the brick with no further issues.

   About the homebrew version...\
   I have tried the homebrew version, but it install a full version of the Dart SDK, even if you already have a version (or multiple) installed.\
   It just adds another version of the Dart SDK. This discouraged me to use the homebrew version.

2. Install the CAT brick\
   Once mason is isntalled you have to install the CAT brick to it.\
   There are two ways of installing bricks using mason, locally or globally.\
   I'd recommend that you install it globally so you can use it in any flutter project, but if you just need it to a single project, you can install it locally.

   
   In the future you will be able to do this just by running

   ```bash
   # Local install
   mason add cat

   # Global install
   mason add cat -g
   ```

   But for now you will have to install it referencing this repository. You can do this by using the following command

   ```bash
   # Local install
   mason add cat -g --git-url https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/mason_cat

   # Global install
   mason add cat -g --git-url https://github.com/SamuelGadiel/mason_cat
   ```

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Using this brick

There are two ways of using bricks. You can simply execute it in the terminal, or if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can install an extension that will help you running it inside a project.

- Using the terminal\
  If you want to use the terminal you can basically run this command

  ```bash
  mason make cat
  ```

  It will ask you for the `module_name` and `has_parameters` variables.\
  Once you entered those informations it will generate everything you need for the module

  Another way you can run this command is by passing the `module_name` and `has_parameters` variables directly in the command

  ```bash
  mason make cat --module_name 'your_module_name' --has_parameters 'false'
  ```

  Mason will ask you for any informations that are ommited, in case you don't pass it.

- Using the VS Code extension
